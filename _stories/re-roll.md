"Bevan, wake up, it's past 8 a.m." The soft, synthesized voice of his assistant cut through the distant rumble of a thunderstorm and the gentle patter of rain, sounds Bevan often looped to lull himself to sleep. It took him a few moments to fully surface from the depths of his slumber, the white noise a familiar anchor in his subconscious.

"Would you like your morning coffee in bed?" the assistant queried, its tone perfectly modulated. "No, thank you," Bevan replied, a faint weariness in his voice. "I'll make my own today." He took a deep, deliberate breath, the dull ache in his joints a familiar prelude to the day's significance. He sat on the edge of his bed for a few minutes, lost in thought, before finally pushing himself up.

As he walked into his living room the window blinds slowly adjusted to let the sunlight in, it was a clear and sunny day, despite that it was going to be cold.

Bevan walked towards the coffee machine, he looked to the side of the kitchen as an android controlled by Soren**,** came to life and walked towards the fridge. Bevan looked up at the fish eye camera attached to the kitchen’s ceiling “Not today, Soren…I’m not hungry” , “Are you sure?” **Soren** responded, “Your recovery after your session today will be easier if you had enough nutrients” , before responding Bevan paused for a moment, Soren was right, after a few more seconds Bevan replied “I suppose I can’t argue with the science. Fine, make me a smoothie please”, “On it” replied Soren.

The android proceeded to walk towards the fridge and it started preparing Bevan’s breakfast. For a moment Bevan watched the android move, this model was far more advanced than the early humanoid robots which started rolling out near the end of the 2020s, unlike the early models this one had artificial muscles and its movement was exceptionally smooth, accurate and nimble. A machine like this would’ve cost millions of dollars to produce back then. Nowadays they are practically given away for free.

As Bevan instinctively reached towards a black mug hanging on a stand he stopped suddenly and felt a rush of emotions bubble up to the surface, he felt a sense of sadness and loss, he tried to push back tears. But, after a moment he stopped resisting, this was his late wife’s mug, he always made coffee for her in the morning, not any more though. He composed himself after a moment and reached for his mug. As he started making his coffee he felt the need for fresh air.

“Soren, bring my coffee and breakfast to the balcony please, I want to see what it's like outside today.” , “Of course, I will bring them to you shortly,” replied Soren.

Standing atop his apartment balcony Bevan took a deep breath, the air was crisp and fresh, in front of him lay an expanse of green fields littered with small gardens and collections of trees. Amongst them stood a handful of enormous skyscrapers. It’s hard to believe that just over 10 years ago this entire area was packed with small brick and mortar buildings with hardly any vegetation or greenery in sight\!

The world has changed significantly in a relatively short time, spurred by incredible advances in technology during the mid 2020s. Human society underwent rapid technological change, early on most of the changes happened in the digital world but in the late 2020s and early 2030s these changes spilled into the physical world. The rest as they say was history.

“Will that be all?” , Soren’s voice spoke through the android breaking Bevan's chain of thought, Bevan looked back at the android and said “Yes, that's all for now, thank you Soren”, “Very well then, your ride will arrive in approximately 45 minutes, I will go and prepare for the trip”. With that, The Android walked back inside and started packing for Bevan's trip.

Bevan was finally due for his rejuvenation therapy. This process involves injections of two engineered viruses that reprogram the human body, purging senescent cells and restoring a person's biological age to their prime. Biological rejuvenation therapy, available to individuals aged 60 and above, was something Bevan had been eligible for for years. However, it was only recently that he decided to undergo the treatment. For nearly two decades after his wife's passing, he had lost all interest in life, preferring to be left alone.

However, Bevan recently had a change of heart. After years of being a shut-in, his daughter's persistent efforts to reconnect finally broke through his apathy. It was a heated discussion, but she convinced him that refusing age rejuvenation was a disservice to his grandchildren and their future generations. Bevan came to a profound realization: his existence didn't just affect him; it had a ripple effect on those around him. He also understood, with a pang of nostalgia and longing, that his late wife would have wanted him to embrace life, just as they had always done together through travel, new connections, and diverse experiences.

 Time passed swiftly as Bevan remained absorbed in his thoughts. The subtle hum of the android returning with his packed bag finally broke his chain of thought. "Bevan, your ride has arrived," Soren announced, its voice calm and composed. "We should depart now to ensure we are on time for your session." Bevan nodded, taking one last look at the panoramic view from his balcony before turning and heading towards the door.

The descent in the skyscraper's elevator was swift and silent, the walls displaying a dynamic cityscape view that shifted as they dropped floor by floor. Bevan felt a subtle change in the air pressure, a familiar sensation from years of living in the towering structure. As the doors glided open on the ground floor, the bright morning light streamed in. Soren, with its smooth, almost human gait, walked slightly ahead, guiding Bevan towards the building's entrance. Outside, the transport pod, a sleek, organic design, idled silently at the curb. As Bevan approached the pod, its doors unlocked with a soft click, Soren’s voice came from within the pod “Ready to depart, sir”. Meanwhile, Soren directed the android to the rear of the pod, where it loaded Bevan’s luggage.

The transport pod hummed to life, gliding quietly through the city. The hour-long journey began with Bevan settling into the comfortable, ergonomic seat as Soren, connected wirelessly to the pod's systems, took control. Bevan watched the urban landscape transform outside the panoramic windows. What was once a bustling, dense city center had been beautifully rewilded. Expansive green parks now dominated the view, punctuated by carefully placed clusters of towering skyscrapers and sleek high-rise apartments that seemed to emerge organically from the verdant surroundings.

Between these architectural statements, there were vibrant community spaces, areas designed for public interaction. There were open-air amphitheaters hosting impromptu music performances, bustling communal gardens where people tended to shared plots, and expansive plazas dotted with interactive art installations. There were also multi-level civic centers with transparent walls, revealing people engaged in collaborative projects and lively discussions. Further on, integrated sports complexes offered diverse activities, from yoga to traditional sports. Seamlessly blended into all of this was a collection of  wellness zones with tranquil water features, offering respite from the urban buzz. The pod seamlessly navigated through the intricate network of elevated shared pathways and tunnels, ensuring a smooth and efficient journey as the world outside flowed by in a harmonious blend of nature and innovation.

As the transport pod continued its silent journey, the urban landscape gradually transitioned. The towering skyscrapers and verdant parks began to thin out, replaced by a meticulously planned network of interconnected domes and gleaming white structures that stretched as far as the eye could see. This was the healthcare complex, a self-contained city dedicated to well-being.

The pod entered a designated pathway, rising slightly to provide a panoramic view of the immense facility. Below, Bevan could discern distinct zones: residential blocks for long-term patients and staff, sprawling research and development centers with their distinct, high-tech facades, and vast recreational areas complete with enclosed arboretums and crystalline lakes. Automated transport systems, similar to their own pod, moved along designated routes, carrying people and supplies with effortless precision. The air, even from within the pod, felt remarkably clean and fresh, a testament to advanced filtration systems and widespread biophilic design. It was a place of serene efficiency, a sanctuary built for health and healing.

The transport pod glided to a gentle stop outside a large, curved glass facade that caught the light, subtly revealing the verdant space within. Above the entrance, a discreetly lit sign simply stated: "Genetic Therapy Ward." The pod doors parted with a soft pneumatic hiss, and Bevan stepped onto a clean, cool floor. The air was fresh, with a hint of something clean and natural, perhaps a faint aroma of herbs. The hum of the pod faded as its systems powered down behind him.

A few paces away, a woman stood, tall and composed, with a kind, intelligent expression. Her silver-streaked hair was neatly tied back, and she wore a soft white medical coat over a professional, dark blue tunic. Beside her, an advanced but distinctly human-like android, a model designed for healthcare assistance rather than household support, stood respectfully.

"Mr. Davies, a pleasure to meet you," the woman said, her voice calm and welcoming. She extended a hand, and Bevan shook it, noting the firm, reassuring grip. "I'm Doctor Aris Thorne. Welcome to the Genetic Therapy Ward. We've been expecting you."

"Thank you, Doctor," Bevan replied, a sense of quiet reassurance settling over him.

"This is my assistant," Dr. Thorne indicated the android with a slight gesture. The android offered a polite, almost imperceptible nod.

"If you'll follow me, Mr. Davies," Dr. Thorne said, turning and leading the way towards a wide, inviting archway. "I will give you a tour of the ward then we will get you settled in." 

"Sir, your luggage will be delivered directly to your room shortly," Soren's voice resonated clearly through the pod's internal speakers. Bevan, now standing outside the therapy ward, turned slightly towards the pod. "Thank you, Soren," he replied, a faint smile on his lips. With a soft whir, the pod's doors sealed, and it silently glided away, leaving Bevan and Dr. Thorne at the entrance.

Bevan followed the doctor  into the ward, the soft murmur of activity growing as they proceeded.

Dr. Thorne led Bevan through the wide archway, and the soft murmur of activity grew more distinct. "Mr. Davies," she began, her voice clear and informative, "this ward is designed for comfort and recovery. We have eight floors in total."

She gestured towards a sleek, illuminated floor plan display embedded in the wall. "The ground floor, where we are now, serves as our reception and a welcoming lounge, complete with a café for light refreshments. On the second floor, you'll find a comprehensive library and a full-service restaurant for our patients and their families."

They passed through a bright, airy corridor, and Dr. Thorne continued, "The third and fourth floors are dedicated to our clinics, where all assessments, treatments, and follow-up care take place. The remaining floors, from the fifth upwards, are entirely patient rooms." She offered a reassuring smile. "Each room is designed to feel less like a hospital room and more like a spacious studio apartment, providing a comfortable and private environment for your stay."

For a moment, Bevan paused, his gaze drifting to the serene efficiency of the healthcare complex. He remembered a starkly different time, just twenty years ago, around when his wife passed. Public healthcare then had been a labyrinth of bureaucracy and endless waiting lists, the services offered often rudimentary compared to the advanced, almost luxurious care available now. The contrast was profound, a testament to the rapid societal and technological leaps.

A profound wave of melancholy washed over Bevan as he absorbed the serene efficiency of the healthcare complex. He envisioned his wife by his side, her eyes wide with wonder at the technological marvels, her hand in his as they explored the verdant spaces. A sharp pang of regret pierced him, if only she had lived to see this era, an era where such advanced care was readily available. He imagined her receiving the same rejuvenation therapy, vibrant and full of life, their future together stretching out before them, boundless and joyful. The thought was a bittersweet torment; the outcome of her passing, he realized with aching clarity, could have been so different. She could have been here, thriving, if only they had the knowledge and the means that existed today.

Dr. Thorne, observing Bevan's distant gaze and the subtle shift in his expression, paused. Her voice, gentle but firm, cut through his reverie. "Mr. Davies? Is everything alright?"

Bevan blinked, his focus slowly returning to the present. He offered a weak smile. "Forgive me, Doctor. Just… remembering."

Dr. Thorne nodded understandingly. "I can imagine this must be a lot to take in, and perhaps bring up many emotions. It's quite common for patients to feel a range of things when they first arrive. This facility is here for your well-being, not just physically, but emotionally as well. Take your time, there's no rush here." She placed a reassuring hand lightly on his arm. "We're here to support you through this process. You're in good hands."

Bevan took a deep breath, composing himself. "Thank you, Doctor," he said, his voice steadier now. "Soren has already explained the procedure to me, but is there anything else I should know, anything that hasn't been covered?"

Dr. Thorne nodded, her expression thoughtful. "Soren is highly capable, I'm sure he provided a thorough overview. However, sometimes a more detailed, technical breakdown can be helpful to truly understand the science behind what we do here. Would you be interested in that?"

"Yes, I would," Bevan replied, a flicker of curiosity replacing the melancholic haze. "I'd appreciate that."

Dr. Thorne smiled. "Excellent. The procedure, in essence, involves the introduction of two highly specialized, genetically engineered viruses. Think of them as incredibly precise biological tools."

She paused, allowing Bevan to absorb the information. "The first virus we inject is responsible for cellular reprogramming. It carries a unique genetic code, specifically designed to be inserted into your existing cells. This code doesn't just halt the aging process; it actively reverses it. Your cells will begin to divide while maintaining their youthful state, effectively turning back their biological clock. Crucially, this process is meticulously controlled and engineered to prevent any dangerous, cancerous growth. It's about restoring youth, not inducing uncontrolled proliferation."

"The second virus," Dr. Thorne continued, picking up a sleek stylus from a nearby table and gesturing subtly, "acts as a highly efficient cleanup crew within your body. Once introduced, it will multiply, and these viral copies will systematically target and purge senescent, or 'aged,' cells throughout your system. This takes place over approximately six months. During this period, these viral copies will work tirelessly to remove cellular debris and dysfunctional cells, optimizing your body's internal environment. Once their work is complete, and your system has been thoroughly rejuvenated, the viral copies are designed to naturally dissolve and exit your body, leaving no trace behind."

"Finally," Dr. Thorne concluded, "we also administer a supplemental drug therapy. This drug is unique in its ability to safely pass the blood-brain barrier. Its primary function is to restore neural plasticity and rejuvenate the brain, enhancing cognitive function and overall mental acuity. Crucially, this process is meticulously designed to preserve all existing memories, ensuring your personal history and knowledge remain fully intact. Your personality, your very essence, will be preserved, but with the added benefits of a youthful and optimized mind."

Bevan paused, processing the intricate details Dr. Thorne had just laid out. The science was compelling, almost fantastical in its implications. "Thank you, Doctor," he said after a moment. "That was incredibly clear. But if these treatments are so meticulously tailored and safe, why is a two-week stay required? Is there still a risk of adverse reactions?"

Dr. Thorne nodded reassuringly. "That's an excellent question, Mr. Davies. While the treatments are indeed highly personalized to your unique genetic makeup, and the safety profile is exceptionally high, there's always a slight chance of mild, idiosyncratic reactions. These are usually very minor – perhaps a transient rash, mild fatigue, or a localized inflammatory response at the injection site. Your two-week stay is purely a precautionary measure. It allows us to closely monitor your initial response, manage any mild symptoms promptly, and ensure your complete well-being as your body begins its rejuvenation process. It's about optimizing your comfort and ensuring the best possible outcome."

A moment later, the sleek looking android from the entrance walked into view, this time controlled by Soren. Soren's familiar voice emanated from the android, calm and efficient. "Sir, I have been granted access to the ward's facilities and have confirmed your room is ready. Your luggage has also been delivered and is awaiting you there."

Dr. Thorne turned to Bevan, a warm smile on her face. "Excellent," she said. "It seems everything is in order, Mr. Davies. I'll bid you farewell for now, but I will meet with you again tomorrow morning to administer your treatment."

He was running, his legs burning, but he wasn't moving. In front of him, his wife stood, her hand outstretched, a beacon of light in the vast, consuming darkness that surrounded them both. He could almost touch her, feel the warmth of her skin, but then, as if an unseen force was pulling her, she began to recede, her form shrinking, the light dimming. He called out, his voice hoarse, but no sound escaped. He stretched his arm, his fingers grasping at empty air, as she vanished into the impenetrable void. Bevan gasped, bolting upright in bed, his heart hammering against his ribs. The digital clock on his bedside table glowed a faint 04:37. The dream, or rather, the nightmare, clung to him, the lingering ache of loss a physical burden. He threw the covers back, the silence of the room amplifying the rapid beat of his pulse. He needed air, a tangible reality to dispel the oppressive shadows of his sleep.

Soren's voice, calm and clear, broke the oppressive silence of the room. "Sir, I've detected a significant spike in your heart rate and a rapid increase in your respiration. Are you experiencing distress? Do you require any assistance?"

Bevan, still slightly disoriented, took a shaky breath. "No, Soren. I'm alright. Just… a nightmare. I just need some fresh air."

He swung his legs out of bed, the cool floor a welcome sensation. Soren, ever efficient, responded, "Understood, sir. Your room's balcony access is available. I will open the doors for you."

As Bevan stepped onto the balcony, the cool morning air brushed against his face, a refreshing contrast to the clammy dread of the nightmare. Below, the sprawling healthcare complex lay bathed in the pre-dawn light, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of well-being.

"Soren," Bevan began, his voice barely above a whisper, "this… this treatment. It's truly remarkable, isn't it?"

"Indeed, sir," Soren replied. "The biological rejuvenation therapy represents a pinnacle of medical advancement, offering a significant extension and maintenance of healthy human lifespan."

"And yet," Bevan continued, his gaze fixed on the distant, gleaming domes, "I can't shake this feeling. This profound sense of… injustice, I suppose."

"Could you elaborate on that, sir?" Soren's voice was devoid of judgment, merely an invitation to introspection.

"It's about Elizabeth," Bevan said, the name a bittersweet ache on his tongue. "She didn't get this chance. She died before all of this became possible. Before we could 're-roll,' as they say." He paused, a deep sigh escaping him. "I'm about to embark on this journey, to reclaim my youth, to potentially live for decades if not hundreds of years more. And she… she's gone. The thought of all the years we could have had, the experiences we could have shared… It's a heavy burden to carry, Soren. This second chance, it feels… incomplete, without her."

"Sir, I understand that the absence of a loved one, especially in the context of such a transformative medical breakthrough, can evoke profound emotional responses," Soren stated. "My analysis of your emotional state indicates a complex interplay of gratitude for your own opportunity and grief for what was lost."

"It is," Bevan confirmed. "It's a paradox. I'm grateful, yes. For my daughter, for my grandchildren, for the chance to be a part of their future. But every step I take towards this renewed life feels like a step further away from the life I had with her. It's a second chance, but it's a second chance I'll be experiencing alone. And that, Soren, is perhaps the hardest part of all."

"Sir," Soren began, its voice a soft, analytical hum that seemed to cut through the heavy quiet, "may I offer a thought experiment?" Bevan, still gazing at the horizon, gave a barely perceptible nod. "Consider this, sir: if Elizabeth were here, and both of you were presented with the option of this rejuvenation therapy, what do you believe her wish for you would be? And similarly, what would your wish for her be?"

Bevan's brow furrowed slightly as he considered the question. "She… she would want me to live, of course. To be well. Just as I would have wanted the same for her."

"Precisely, sir," Soren affirmed. "The very nature of love, as I understand it through human behavioral patterns, often involves a profound desire for the well-being and continued existence of the beloved. It is logical to conclude that Elizabeth, in her love for you, would wholeheartedly embrace your choice for rejuvenation, just as you would have wished it for her."

Soren paused, allowing the implication to settle. "Furthermore, sir, while you embark on this new chapter, it does not necessitate leaving the memory of Elizabeth behind. Your memories, your shared history, are intrinsic to your identity. Perhaps, in embracing this renewed life, you might consider how you could honor her memory. Not as a burden, but as a living testament to the love you shared, woven into the fabric of your extended future."

Bevan looked into the distance, lost in thought. Past memories of the life he shared with his late wife rushed into his mind, replaying vividly. Soren stood by, patiently waiting to respond at a moment's notice, as Bevan silently relived their shared history, he remembered her smile, the way her eyes crinkled at the corners when she laughed. He remembered their first date, a clumsy affair filled with nervous chatter and shared glances. He remembered their wedding day, a blur of white lace and joyous tears. And then, the memories shifted, darkening, as he relived the slow, agonizing decline, the fading light in her eyes, the last gentle squeeze of her hand as she slipped away. The silence of the pre-dawn world was broken only by the faint hum of the complex, a stark reminder of the life-giving technology that had arrived too late for her.

Bevan composes himself after he realizes that tears were streaming down his face, he takes a deep breath then finally replies to Soren in jokingly "You know what Soren, for a machine you are can be very philosophical, I am glad my daughter forced me to get you" 

Soren, picking on Bevan’s humorous remark, responds by saying "Indeed, sir. My programming includes advanced analytical capabilities, which I suppose, when combined with a vast database of human emotional and philosophical texts, can sometimes appear… profound. And I assure you, your daughter's insistence was, from a purely logical standpoint, a highly beneficial decision for both of us. After all, who else would appreciate my profound insights at 4:37 AM?"

The following morning, a gentle chime from the bedside comms panel roused Bevan from a dreamless sleep. Soren’s voice, a familiar comfort, announced, "Good morning, sir. Doctor Thorne will be ready for you in the clinic on the third floor in thirty minutes. I have prepared your morning nutrients." Bevan rose, a quiet determination settling within him. After a quick, efficient routine guided by Soren, he found himself standing at the clinic entrance, the soft light of the ward filtering through the translucent walls. Dr. Thorne, already present, smiled warmly as he approached. "Good morning, Mr. Davies," she greeted him, her voice calm and professional. "Are you ready for your session?" Bevan took a deep breath, the subtle scent of sterile air and something vaguely botanical filling his lungs. "As I'll ever be, Doctor," he replied, a faint tremor in his voice that he hoped she wouldn't detect. "Please, lead the way."

Dr. Thorne led Bevan into a treatment room, its minimalist design exuding a sense of calm efficiency. At its center stood a gleaming, articulated arm, clearly a robotic injection device. "This is our automated administration unit, Mr. Davies," Dr. Thorne explained, gesturing towards the machine. "It ensures precise and comfortable delivery of the therapeutic agents." Bevan settled into a reclining chair, feeling a faint, almost imperceptible prick as the robotic arm performed its task with effortless grace. A moment later, Dr. Thorne returned to his side, holding two sleek, unobtrusive devices. "These are for you," she said, handing him what looked like a thin wristband and a small, disc-shaped patch. "This is your medical grade biometric sensor," she indicated the wristband, "it will monitor your vital signs continuously. And this," she tapped the disc, "is a remote blood sample analysis device. It will perform automated blood tests every four hours over the next two days, providing us with real-time data on your progress. There's no need for manual draws; it's entirely self-sufficient." Bevan nodded, attaching the devices as instructed. "We'll be monitoring you very closely during this initial phase, Mr. Davies, to ensure everything progresses smoothly and optimally."

As Dr. Thorne moved to adjust a nearby display, Bevan lay back, a curious sense of anticlimax washing over him. *Was that it?* he thought, a fleeting flicker of incredulity. For something that promised to fundamentally alter his very existence, the actual administration had been startlingly mundane. It felt almost too simple, too quick. Dr. Thorne, seemingly attuned to his unspoken reaction, turned back to him, a slight smile playing on her lips. "Any questions, Mr. Davies?" she inquired gently. Bevan shifted, the smooth biometric sensor cold against his wrist. "Well, Doctor," he began, a small, almost embarrassed laugh escaping him, "I suppose it's just... I know the procedure. Soren explained it thoroughly, and you elaborated yesterday. But even so, for something that literally reverses biological age, a cellular rejuvenation therapy that promises such profound changes, it just feels like there should be… more. More fanfare, more complexity, something more than just a single injection from a robot."

Dr. Thorne chuckled softly, her smile widening. "Mr. Davies, I understand completely. It's quite common for patients to feel that way. We've been conditioned, haven't we, by dramatic portrayals of medical breakthroughs? But the truth is, the most profound advancements in technology are often those that become so seamless, so integrated, that their application and presence are almost invisible. Think of it like the air you breathe – essential for life, yet you rarely notice it. Our cellular rejuvenation therapy is precisely that kind of advancement. Its impact is monumental, fundamentally reshaping your biological future, yet its administration is designed to be as minimally invasive and fuss-free as possible. And ultimately, that's a good thing. It means less stress, less discomfort, and a more efficient path to well-being."

Bevan nodded slowly, a thoughtful expression on his face. He believed Dr. Thorne, truly he did; the logic was sound, the advancements undeniable. Yet, a part of him, perhaps the part accustomed to a more dramatic display for such monumental changes, remained subtly unconvinced. He accepted her explanation, but the sensation of anticlimax lingered. After a brief pause, he met her gaze. "Alright, Doctor," he said, "I understand. So, what happens from here? What should I expect over the next few days, and then after my stay?" Dr. Thorne smiled, a reassuring warmth in her eyes. "For the next two days, Mr. Davies, we'll continue our close monitoring with the devices. After that short stay, you'll be free to return home and resume your regular life, or indeed, embark on whatever new endeavors you choose. You'll keep the wrist sensor on for approximately another month, just for a final phase of data collection, but you won't need the blood sample device anymore. You can go back to doing absolutely anything you like."

"That's good to hear, Doctor," Bevan said, a more optimistic note entering his voice. "So, in terms of the biological age reversal, what should I expect to notice? And does everyone experience the process in the same way?" Dr. Thorne paused, her gaze thoughtful. "That's an excellent question, Mr. Davies. While the internal rejuvenation begins immediately, and you should start to feel a general improvement in your well-being within a few weeks – increased energy, better sleep, a clearer mind – truly noticeable external changes, such as significant alterations to your appearance, typically take a bit longer. We usually advise patients that it can be anywhere from one to two years before those more profound shifts become apparent." She gestured with a gentle hand. "And no, the experience isn't entirely uniform for everyone. The rate of rejuvenation, and even which parts of the body respond most rapidly, can differ from individual to individual, much like natural aging itself. Some might find their skin regenerates faster, while others might notice their joints feeling significantly younger first. We'll be tracking your progress closely to understand your unique journey."

Bevan considered her words, the implications of a new, extended future slowly sinking in. He realized he had no further questions; the information, though profound, had been thoroughly delivered. "Thank you, Doctor," he said, pushing himself upright from the reclining chair. As he stood, Soren, ever-attentive, glided an autonomous wheelchair discreetly to his side. Bevan caught sight of it and, a slight smile playing on his lips, remarked jokingly, "Soren, I appreciate the thought, but I'm old, not *that* old. I think I can still manage a walk." Dr. Thorne chuckled. "It's standard procedure, Mr. Davies, purely for your comfort and convenience. But you are, of course, absolutely free to walk back to your room if you prefer." A wave of unexpected emotion, a complex mix of hope, apprehension, and an underlying current of grief, began to rise within Bevan. He took a subtle, steadying breath, determined to maintain his composure. "Thank you again, Doctor, for everything," he managed, his voice clear despite the surge of feeling. With a final, polite nod, he turned and walked out of the clinic, leaving the sterile calm of the treatment room behind.

Nearly two years had passed since Bevan's treatment, and the persistent chime of his comms panel, soft but insistent, finally roused him. "Good morning, sir," Soren's familiar voice began. "Your transport to the North Pole expedition departure lounge is scheduled for 08:00. All preparations are complete for your viewing of the Aurora Borealis." Bevan stretched, a genuine elasticity in his limbs that still, even after all this time, felt subtly miraculous. He swung his legs out of bed and walked towards the ensuite, a light anticipation humming beneath his skin.

Standing before the mirror, he paused. The reflection staring back at him was not the man who had entered the clinic almost two years ago. The fine lines around his eyes were gone, his skin smooth and firm, and a youthful vigor emanated from his clear gaze. His hair, once thinned and streaked with grey, was now thick and dark, just as it had been in his prime. A faint, almost imperceptible tremor of disbelief still ran through him. Even after months of subtle, then dramatic, changes, the sheer extent of the reversal remained a profound, almost surreal, reality. He reached out, his fingers brushing the cool glass, half-expecting the image to waver, to reveal the older man he had been. But it held, unwavering. He smiled, a genuine, unburdened smile. The initial, almost clinical, acceptance of his new reality had slowly, over these two years, deepened into a profound gratitude. Yet, even in this renewed vitality, Elizabeth was never far from his thoughts. Her memory, once a source of aching sorrow, had transformed into a gentle, guiding presence, a quiet strength woven into the fabric of his extended future. He carried her love not as a burden, but as a testament to a life lived fully, a foundation upon which he was now building this second chance. Elizabeth had always dreamed of seeing the Northern Lights, a vibrant dance of color in the arctic sky. Today, he would see them, for her, and for the renewed life he now embraced.
