You wake up with a jolt, your breathing quick and shallow, the phantom feeling of anxiety still clinging to you. The dream was vivid—a "FINAL NOTICE" letter, the exhaustion of working two jobs, the flashing red light on a dashboard. You instinctively check the time, bracing for the pre-dawn panic. But it's light outside, the warmth of the sun already on your face. It’s almost 8 am. You let out a deep breath, and smile. It was just a dream. A memory of a world that no longer exists.

"Just another echo," you think to yourself. You rarely get them anymore, these ghosts from the "Age of Scarcity." You stretch, feeling the deep, restorative peace of a full night's sleep. You know exactly why things are so good now, and you can't help but feel grateful for how far everyone has come.

You have a few hours before you need to be at the community hub, "I should get in a quick study session," you think. You're learning a new language, just because you can. There’s no stress of being late, no consequences to fear. Your schedule has already been gently optimized for your wellbeing, just as it always is.

The "Age of Scarcity" feels like a distant memory. At the same time, how the world transformed and embraced abundance in relatively short years still feels miraculous. You know it was a gradual shift, and you know it wasn't just one policy, but a total realignment of society. Regardless of how it happened, everyone you know seems to be thriving, free to pursue their passions. You are all... free.

You catch yourself mid-thought, "Enough dwelling on the past, now is the time to plan, a wonderful day ahead...."

After a relaxing morning, you are out of bed, getting ready for the day... For your main project, that is. You volunteer full-time as a community educator (the new name for "teacher") because you love it. In the afternoons, you’re a sculptor. In between, you occasionally join "philosophy jams" where you and others just talk about big ideas, a popular pastime now that day to day survival is no longer a concern.

You check the public transit app before you leave home, a pod is two minutes away, as always. Leaving is easy. Just as you are about to leave your apartment, you notice a message on your wall screen. "SOCIAL DIVIDEND: FULLY ALLOCATED." It’s not a handout, not welfare; it's the direct return on a society that everyone—from artists to engineers to carers—builds and contributes to. Your share of the collective abundance, energy, and resources, deposited. You smile, another month where the fundamentals of bills, rent, and food are simply handled, freeing you to contribute in your own way.

On your way to the hub, a sleek autonomous pod glides silently beside yours. You briefly glance over and notice a family, the kids are sharply dressed in unique, self-made clothing, laughing and collaborating on a holographic model. You wonder if they will grow to become artists, builders, explorers, scientists or engineers. It doesn't matter. You know most of the complex "labor" is automated, so people are free to pursue creativity, science, and community. There are no "asset owners" in the old sense; everyone has a stake in the automated systems the run and produce almost everything. You sigh, a deep, contented breath, and focus on the beautiful, clean city ahead.

You arrive at the hub, you have a bit of time before the kids do, so you decide to get breakfast from the hub’s cafe. You’re hungry, so you order a full, nutrient-rich meal and a perfect coffee, made from high quality fresh ingredients and prepared by an automated kitchen. It costs you nothing.

Just before class, you review your lesson plan, which has already been populated with helpful resources and immersive VR environments. It's going to be a fun day; you’re exploring marine biology. You only have a small group of children (thanks to the focus on quality of life, you have all the support you need!) and all the admin overhead is handled automatically, leaving you free to simply connect, inspire, and play.

At lunch, you start to wonder again, "When did life get so... simple?" You have your own beautiful apartment, no roommates (unless you want them), and your needs are completely met. Yet, somehow, you have all the time and energy in the world to contribute and create.

At the same time, you read and hear stories about new breakthroughs in science, art, and exploration. Obscene amounts of progress are being shared, social media is full of genuine posts of people sharing their creations, their travels, their learnings. You know these posts are real and you can't help but feel good about how you "found your place in life," and how everyone else seems to be finding theirs, too.

You see technology advancements every day, more integration, helpful systems, robots walking alongside people as collaborators, in labs, gardens, and kitchens. Not to mention orbital construction, 3D-printed organs (available to everyone!), marvelous biomedical advancements that have dramatically increased healthspans. Yet somehow, more and more people are thriving. The concept of a "middle class" is gone, replaced by just... humanity.

On the other hand, everyone seems to be reaping the benefits. The automated systems are managed as a public utility, a global trust. You don't begrudge anyone their happiness and wouldn't wish anyone ill, because you just can't help and think that the system is finally fair.

After all, the systems were designed to look after us, their core ethics and social safety nets built to ensure a high standard of living for everyone. The rich didn't get richer; wealth was just... redistributed. It doesn't matter that there is more than enough to go around, what matters is that the current systems use managed abundance to ensure access to all resources, including the desire for purpose.

You start to wonder whether being a philosopher or an economist in the old days would have been stressful, instead of being just another person with the freedom to learn. Just as you are about to go on that tangent, the bell rings and you snap back to reality, 3 more hours of fun to go!

After a brief, recharging break, you arrive at your other project: the community art studio. It's Friday, so the place is buzzing with creative energy. This place prides itself on having human artists and personalized creations, and everyone comes here to learn, collaborate, and share. Robotic arms , 3D printers and other advanced tools are available to assist, augmenting human skill rather than replacing it. Places like this are everywhere, since the "human experience" is the only thing that matters.

You are thankful for this fact, because if that wasn't the case you wouldn't have found this passion. But, you also know that if you were to drop the ball... nothing would happen. You’d just pick it up tomorrow, or try something new. There are 100s of people waiting in line to help you with your sculpture.

You start work, chiseling at a block of marble. A man you vaguely recognize from the age of scarcity, someone who used to be a "CEO" or a "billionaire" is working at the potter's wheel nearby, covered in clay. He's... humming. He waves at you with a genuine, simple smile. Your guard is non-existent; you smile and wave back.

"I've been waiting to try that color glaze for a while," he says, "I thought this place prides itself on creative freedom!" He's joking. You laugh, and tell him it’s all his. Part of you wants to ask him about his old life, but you realize how oblivious you are to his past, and how little it matters now.

It is almost 10 pm, you are on your way home, pleasantly tired, fulfilled, both mentally and physically. You feel the satisfied buzz of a day well-spent. Your digital assistant catalogs the progress on your sculpture and suggests a new chisel technique to try tomorrow. You feel tears building up, this is exactly what life is supposed to be! Why did it take humanity so long to realize this? Why did so many have to suffer? Who was finally willing to do something about it?

You collect your thoughts and remind yourself that things are no longer bad. The world is going through a period of shared prosperity, there are no more war-torn countries, economic downturns, poverty, rampant crime or people dealing with terminal illnesses, because most of that was solved, too. You are lucky, your life is amazing. You repeat that to yourself, and you know, with every fiber of your being, that it's true.
