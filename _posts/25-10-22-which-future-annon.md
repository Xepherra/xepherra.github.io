You wake up, your breathing is quick and shallow, sweat covering your skin. It's still dark outside, you instinctively check the time, it's not even 5 am! You try to calm yourself down by breathing slowly...

"Just another nightmare" you think to yourself, how many so far just this month? way more than normal, you know something is wrong but you just can't put your finger on it.

Just over an hour before you have to get out of bed, "I should get more rest" but you worry you might oversleep and not wake up on time, the consequences for that will be very stressful (as if you needed any more stress!)

You can't really remember how life got this bad, you know it happened gradually and you know it is not just you, many of your friends and colleagues seem to be having similar experiences, you are all stuck!

You catch yourself mid-thought, "Now is not the time to worry, a long day ahead...."

After a restless period of time you are out of bed, getting ready for work...For your first job that is. You work full time as a pre-school teacher and during the evenings you work at an upmarket restaurant, 2 out of 7 evenings but the schedule is sometimes unpredictable. In between you occasionally do the odd post-AI gig work where you personally deliver handcrafted goods or letters to people, rich people mostly.

You check the traffic before you leave home, you got lucky this morning, leaving a bit earlier than usual so traffic won't be much of a problem, you thank the gods for smiling upon you. Just as you are about to leave your apartment you notice the letter you left at the table the evening before, "FINAL NOTICE" , another overdue bill. You curse yourself for forgetting about this but you realize you cannot do anything until your next paycheck arrives in 2 days.

On your way to work, a luxury self-driving car passes you by, you briefly glance to your side and notice a group of young people sharply dressed, talking and laughing while the car is driving autonomously, you wonder if they are a bunch of tech-bros, VCs or finance bros, probably heading to the city center for "work" , you know most of knowledge work is automated these days but people at this level must be asset owners who have played the right moves in the game of life. Unlike you, they don't need to worry about paying late bills or that red light flashing on your dashboard, you sigh, focus back on the road ahead of you and carry on.

You arrive at work, you have a bit of a breather before the day starts, you decide to get coffee from a nearby cafe`, you are also hungry but very cash strapped, coffee alone will do for now you can last till lunch time.

Just before class you pop your anti-anxiety meds, it's going to be a long day since you are on shift at the restaurant tonight, you need to keep it together. Aside from a couple of kids throwing tantrums the morning was uneventful but between looking after a large group of kids (thanks to cost cutting you now have more work!) and the admin overhead of your job (which seems to not be factored into your pay!) you are kept busy.

At lunch, you start to wonder again "When did life get so hard?" , you are single, no kids, no mortgage and your expenses are relatively minimal. You live in an ok apartment with 2 other roommates,good people but like you they are always busy and trying to stay afloat so you don't get a chance to interact with them that much. Yet, somehow you just can't seem to stay afloat without burning yourself out.

At the same time, you read and hear stories about individuals and companies growing valuations, obscene figures being thrown around, billions mean nothing anymore, social media is full of pretentious posts of people living the high life, you know some of these posts are fake but can't help feel bad about how you "lost at the game of life" while they seem to have it all figured out.

You keep on seeing technology advancements every day, more automation, more powerful AIs, robots walking alongside people, in factories, logistics and now even in some restaurants and cafes! Not to mention delivery drones, 3D printed buildings, marvelous biomedical advancements (which your basic insurance does not cover!), yet somehow more and more people are struggling, the middle class is all but destroyed

On the other hand, a small group of people seems to be reaping all the benefits, politicians, VCs, super asset owners. You don't begrudge people for working hard and smart to climb the ladder and wouldn't wish anyone ill but you just can't help and think that the system is not fair.

After all, our elected politicians were meant to look after us, regulatory oversight and social safety nets were supposed to have been put in place to ensure a reasonable standard of living for everyone, yet somehow the rich get richer and everyone else is worse off. It doesn't matter that there is more than enough to go around, what matters is that the current systems use artificial scarcity to control access to resources, including basic needs.


You start to wonder whether being a philosopher or an economist would have made you better off financially instead of being yet another person with a BA but just as you are about to go on that tangent the bell rings and you snap back to reality, 3 more hours to go!

After a brief break (if you can call it that) you arrive at your second job, it's Friday so the place is going to be busy, this place prides itself on having human chefs and personalized services, rich people dine here, for the experience mainly, since robotic kitchens and butlers are more than capable of matching anything a human can do (while costing far less), places like this are still around since the human experience is more "authentic", at least that's how the restaurant markets itself.

You are thankful for this fact because if that wasn't the case you wouldn't have your second job and you will be struggling to pay rent! But, you also know that if you were to drop the ball then replacing you will not be an issue at all, there are 100s of people waiting in line to take your shifts.

You start work, standing by the entrance to greet patrons, a slick luxury car slows down to drop a couple, it's a self-driving car, again. The luxury vehicle industry has adopted self-driving tech very quickly, mainly because passengers would feel a lot more comfortable in a self-driving car compared to being driven by a human chauffeur. Manual driving is still around and low-cost self-driving rideshares are also available but it's still a cost you would rather not incur and have opted to drive your own car, even though it is falling apart.

You look at the couple, two ladies, both stunning and appear to be in their late 20s at the most, it's hard to tell how old a person is sometimes, especially when it comes to the rich, age-reversal therapies are available to them, cost is not an issue.

Their eyes meet yours as if expecting you to do something, you snap back to reality again and do what any good servant would do, going through the motions as if on auto-pilot, you smile, greet them warmly and guide them to a table.

After seating them one of them looks at you and thanks you with a genuine smile, you take the compliment and feel a bit better, it's nice to be appreciated from time to time, even when it comes to the little things. Almost instantly and as if the universe noticed your moment of content and decided to punish you for it! You notice someone waving at you, a large group of diners are at the big table in the corner, looking at the bottles of wine and champagne it is obvious that they have had a few, you take a deep breath in preparation for what is to come.

As you approach one of the guys in the group smiles, something is weird about him, unlike the couple before, his smile seems mischievous, your guard goes up but at the same time you know that you have to remain friendly and professional.

"We've been waiting to order for a while, I thought this place prides itself on exceptional service??" , part of you wants to fire back at the guy and to make him realize how oblivious he is to his surroundings, it is Friday night and the restaurant is full, the staff are doing their best to look after everyone.

But no, doing that means risking bad feedback and the chance of losing this gig, so you keep your mouth shut, compose yourself and politely apologize to him and his group. As soon as you have sent the order to the kitchen you walk away and hope that one of your colleagues will deal with them for the rest of the night.

It is almost midnight, you are on your way home, exhausted, both mentally and physically. You feel the stress knots inside of you but what can you do? AI therapy helps but without treating the underlying symptoms and escaping your financial situation you are destined to live this life until you retire. IF you can afford to retire that is. You feel tears building up, this cannot be all there is to life!?? Not when we have the technology and resources to make everyone live like royalty? Why is luxury only available to so few? Why are more and more people suffering? Who is willing to do anything about this?

You collect your thoughts and remind yourself that things could be much worse, you can be living in a war torn country or dealing with terminal illness, you are lucky, your life isn't too bad, you repeat that to yourself as if doing so will make it true.

You crash in your bed and start to fall asleep from exhaustion. It's the weekend, a few chores and a couple of gigs to do tomorrow followed by hours of doomscrolling where you are constantly comparing yourself to those who appear to live a life far better than yours. Your final thought before you sleep is "The struggle is getting worse but I'm too tired to worry about that right now...."
