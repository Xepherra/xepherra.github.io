This is a placeholder blog post to confirm that your **blog listing** and **post layout** work properly.

You can write posts in plain Markdown — use **headings**, *italics*, lists, and even code blocks:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from Jekyll!")
```

When you're ready, replace this entry with a real post to share news, behind-the-scenes thoughts, or long-form musings about your stories.
