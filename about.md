Hi, I'm Firas (also known as Xepherra / Xeph in some online hangouts). By day I am a software engineer and a technical & people leader, by night I am a gamer, sci-fi reader, futurist, AI researcher and an armchair game designer! 

I've been around the block for long enough to realize that no matter how much I learn there is still so much more I don't know and that is one of the things that keeps me going.
