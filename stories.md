# Overview
Here you will find a collection of short stories I have written over time, some have been recently published but they have more or less gone thorugh a few re-incarnations over the years (both in my head and in the cloud!)

## A note on the use of AI
Most of these stories have been edited and fleshed out with the help of ChatGPT and Gemini. However, the themes, characters, flow and interactions of the stories is my own work.
