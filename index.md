Welcome to my little corner of cyberspace, after an eternity of prorcrastination I have finally decided to build a personal site and host it on Github pages.

I may or may not actively work on this site but all of my future posts and content will be either hosted or referenced here!

A good place to start would be the **[About](/about)** page. Or, if you are in the mood for some reading then feel free to checkout the **[Stories](/stories/)** section.
